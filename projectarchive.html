                <p> Trinity Wizards is a single player puzzle game. The player simultaneously controls three wizards.
                    One is controlled with the keyboard, one with the mouse and the last wizard is controlled via headtracking.
                    My first task in this project was setting up the head-tracking controls for the third wizard.
                    I used the open source head tracking software Opentrack in conjunction with AITrack.
                    AITrack uses facial recognition via the webcam to track the head-position of the user.
                    The data is given to OpenTrack, to interpret and sent to Unity next.
                    In the Game, the head-position indicates where the wizard is supposed to go.
                    I also implemented different gameplay elements for the puzzle elements:
                    I wrote a portal system capable of teleporting particles and I created turret enemies.
                    I also implemented feedback elements to show the player, what their actions in the game are doing.
